  <h1>Welcome Space Traveler!</h1>
  <p>Your are now in the Milky Way Galaxy. The planet with the highest population is Earth, so we will now use the Earthling scale of time. For those not paying attention; 1 tic = 1 "second", 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in a solar year. Now that we have that out of the way we will calculate your age on a few of the planets, so you can blend into the poplulation easier!</p>
